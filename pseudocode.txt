Note: this initial implementation is for grayscale images
Pseudocode steps:

Encode
- Image is split into blocks of two pixels each
- For each block
	- compute the difference (diff) between their intensity values
	- ranges of possible differences
		- #: (lower#, upper#) -> bits#
		- 1: (0, 7) -> 3
		- 2: (8, 15) -> 3
		- 3: (16, 31) -> 4
		- 4: (32, 63) -> 5
		- 5: (64, 127) -> 6
		- 6: (128, 255) -> 7
	- size of encoding in block determined by formula (bits#), where upper# and lower# correspond to the range of possible differences diff falls into
		- t = [logbase2(upper# - lower# + 1)]
		- ex: diff of 40 -> logbase2(63-32+1) = 5 bits
	- check that the additional diff encoding will not cause over/underflow on pixels
	- bit sequence of text as decimal value (td)
	- newdiff = td + lower
	- modified pixel values calculated as follows (newpixel1, newpixel2)
		- m = abs(newdiff - diff)
		- if (pixel1 >= pixel2) and (newdiff > diff)
			- (pixel1 + (m/2), pixel2 - (m/2))
		- if (pixel1 < pixel2) and (newdiff > diff)
			- (pixel1 - (m/2), pixel2 + (m/2))
		- if (pixel1 >= pixel2) and (newdiff <= diff)
			- (pixel1 - (m/2), pixel2 + (m/2))
		- if (pixel1 < pixel2) and (newdiff <= diff)
			- (pixel1 + (m/2), pixel2 - (m/2))
	- pixel1 and pixel2 are replaced by stego pixels newpixel1 and newpixel2
	- repeat with next block 
		- if message is fully encoded, encode rest of the pixels with zeroes

Decode
- Image is split into blocks of two pixels each
- For each block
	- compute the difference (diffp) between their intensity values
	- check whether block would have been ruled out for possible over/underflow on pixels
	- extract data with equation
		- bit sequence = abs(diffp - lower#)
	- store every 8 bits into a byte/char and append to string
	- repeat with new blocks until the message is fully decoded
		- if text: stop when last byte equals zero
